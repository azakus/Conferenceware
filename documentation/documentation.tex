\part{Description}
Conferenceware is a web-based project for running a conference. Specifically, the software was designed to run the ACM Reflections|Projections conference. It is outfitted with features to support everything from registration to event staff scheduling to printing name badges for staff and attendees.  The software was designed to eliminate redundant actions, prevent the introduction of invalid data and, most importantly, make running a large conference easier.
